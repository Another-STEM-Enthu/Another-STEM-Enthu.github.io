    "content": "<b>Ever felt a sting to not switch tasks?</b> You're working on a task, and suddenly you realise that you need to switch to something else. An interruption to that sweet uptake of dopamine you get while being \"zoned-in\". My parents always motivate me that I should try switching tasks quickly and switch \"zones\".<br><br><b>Why is it that I can switch between some tasks easily and some require a resolute exercise of will or actually never end up being done?</b><br> I wonder if this has got to do with plasticity. The more time you spend doing certain tasks, more does the brain adapt to those and it becomes easier to perform those tasks. Some tasks you do without paying conscious attention like typing, listening to music in the background... so, moving from no music to music while studying is never a barrier for me. But say, you're writing code in python and you suddenly need to supplement the math behind the code with commentary in latex. To conclude the response to this question, I think there may be 2 types of tasks that are difficult to switch to- one, those that you are not good at; two, those which are not particularly fun to do(do not trigger copious dopamine release). Adapting to new tasks involves rewiring, it takes energy and time. Thus, the brain naturally will try to resist expenditure of energy; makes sense, right?<br><br><br><b>Is there a way to tackle it?</b><br>I say \"fake it till you make it\". When there is resistance to switch, try to assert that you're getting good at it and you're understanding the intricacies of the task. Maybe listing some out/understanding them is a good way to start. A boost to this can be achieved with some fun activity such as a small snack or your favourite music!<br><br>Fun after-thought: Is not being in the mood for something an emotional manifestation of plasticity? or maybe it is just a skepticism expressed due to a poor past experience. <br>Given how much time we spend in our brains, it is surprising how little we try to introspect its functioning."

    "content": "<h4><p>I was reading a recent MIT study about accumulation of cognitive debt in GPT users, which lead to thinking about habit-forming.</p><p>It is my personal opinion that the best use case of modern LLMs is gathering information on topics you know little about. It is GOOD at giving you the relevant information - so good that an LLM has been my go-to for understanding new things lately.<br>As I was happily able to | grep(if you may 😊)new info, something concerning occurred to me - \"is this info reliable and complete?\" To verify this, I would ask the model to search for and cite sources, and then personally tap them for verification. Had I done a search for the relevant info, I could have gone straight to the source and just read that.</p><p>It becomes important to perform a fact-check when dealing with nuances in a regime you know little about. Apart from the distrust in completeness and authenticity of information that LLMs can furnish us with, there's a certain vibe to well-structured stackoverflow posts and good old blogs, that I do not see in LLMs - that human element. </p></p>From a user's perspective, I would not be comfortable to have LLMs(or LLM-driven search engines for that matter) replace a search on the web and books, for dealing with nuanced topics just YET. <br>As for getting an introduction to new ideas, LLMs are a life-saver!</p><br><br>P.S. No AI was used in crafting this post - you are likely to find deficiencies in the post upon closer inspection 😂</h4>"

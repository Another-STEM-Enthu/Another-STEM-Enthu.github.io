    "content": "<h4><p>I was reading a recent MIT study about accumulation of cognitive debt in GPT users, which lead to thinking about habit-forming.</p><p>It is my personal opinion that the best use case of modern LLMs is gathering information on topics you know little about. It is GOOD at giving you the relevant information - so good that an LLM has been my go-to for understanding new things lately.<br>As I was happily able to | grep(if you may ðŸ˜Š)new info, something concerning occurred to me - \"is this info reliable and complete?\" To verify this, I would ask the model to search for and cite sources, and then personally tap them for verification. Had I done a search for the relevant info, I could have gone straight to the source and just read that.</p><p>It becomes important to perform a fact-check when dealing with nuances in a regime you know little about. Apart from the distrust in completeness and authenticity of information that LLMs can furnish us with, there's a certain vibe to well-structured stackoverflow posts and good old blogs, that I do not see in LLMs - that human element. </p></p>From a user's perspective, I would not be comfortable to have LLMs(or LLM-driven search engines for that matter) replace a search on the web and books, for dealing with nuanced topics just YET. <br>As for getting an introduction to new ideas, LLMs are a life-saver!</p><br><br>P.S. No AI was used in crafting this post - you are likely to find deficiencies in the post upon closer inspection ðŸ˜‚</h4>"
